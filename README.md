# Project 3: Spots

## Description

Spots is a website design project I created using Figma. The goal was to design a clean and simple website that looks great on both desktop and mobile devices. I focused on making the layout easy to use and responsive for mobile users.

### Overview  

* Intro 
* Figma  
* Images  
  
**Intro**
  
This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.  
  
**Figma**

**Images**  
  
The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster. 
  
Good luck and have fun!
